% for example upload the wrong file.

% The format (A5) is selected to facilitate reading on small

Here is some type set Java code. 

\begin{lstlisting}

If you don't want to copy the code into the document you can pull it directly from the source file instead:

\lstinputlisting{example.java}

Or you can pick out just a few selected lines:

\lstinputlisting[firstline=3, lastline=3]{example.java}

To quote a source you use \cite{Weiss}, or \cite[sid. 25]{Weiss}. Sources are kept in the file bibtex.bib.
